Consider a graph that initially contains n vertices and no edges. Randomly include one edge at a time until the graph is connected; that is, until there is only one connected component. Plot the expected number of edges that must be included before the graph is connected against n. Can you find a function f(n) such that f(n) is close to the expected number of edges that must be included? For a few values of n, use your samples to estimate g n (m) = Pr{after m edges, the n vertex graph is connected}. Plot your estimates of g n ; do you notice anything surprising? Can you find any threshold beyond which the graph gets connected with high probability? Use graph plots to show your results.
